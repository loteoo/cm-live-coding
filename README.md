# cm-live-coding

You can view the app here: https://cm-live-coding-loteoo.netlify.app/

The session started with a boilerplate with:
- Vite.js for dev environment
- React / TypeScript
- Picocss class-less styling library
- Node.js / PostgreSQL / Koa / TypeScript backend (we didn't use it after all)


## Note

This is the code "as-is" at the end of the live-coding session, much is left unfinished and not cleaned up properly. Please watch the recording to see context on how the code was developped on-the-fly :)

## Development

```
npm run dev
```
